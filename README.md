# CoreWiki

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/FritzAndFriends/CoreWiki/_apis/build/status/CoreWiki-CI)](https://dev.azure.com/FritzAndFriends/CoreWiki/_build/latest?definitionId=4)

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/) 

A simple ASP.NET Core wiki that we are working on during live coding streams. It runs on Windows, Mac, Linux and Container. Core Wiki is an allusion to the Core App. This name was suggested by Shayne Boyer in the stream of the [27th/March](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/243463398). Initially this project is very basic and anyone who is learning ASP.NET Core 2.0 (Razor Pages) can use it to learn.

To learn more about Jeff's stream check his [Live Stream Repository](https://github.com/csharpfritz/Fritz.LiveStream).

## CoreWiki Streams Archive

Archive of all shows from the stream can be found on [Jeff's YouTube 'Building the CoreWiki'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVMqA0_8O85yC78I4Xj7z48ES48IQBa7p)  playlist.
